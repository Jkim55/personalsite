      <h3> Where I've Been </h3>
        <p class="text">
          The path I travelled to pursue programming is kind of a meandering one.
          I started off by studying Economics as an undergrad and working in Investment
          Management after graduation. While I loved working with my clients and
          studying the economic forces that drive the market, I found this career
          to be a bit too dry and I needed to be more creative. So, I searched
          something that would allow me to engage my creative side more and I eventually
          landed on interior design. As a designer, I found that I loved the
          creative problem solving aspects of the work. However, the day-to-day
          was not particularly challenging and I needed something that was going to
          challenge me while engaging both my creative and analytical sides. So,
          I searched again and landed on programming, which is most definitely
          challenging, creative and analytical. A perfect fit!

      <h3> Where I'm Currently</h3>
        <p class="text">
          I'm just a few days away from starting the Full Stack Immersive (FSI) program
          at Galvanize and I'm so excited. At this point, I have a bit of experience with Ruby,
          a faint familiarity of Javascript, and no experience with CSS/HTML outside
          of the gSchool prework. So, I consider myself a complete beginner at the
          start of the program. I have a lot to learn and thrilled to build my
          knowledge base with fellow students!

        <p id='center'> I don't know .js, but let's goooooooooo-ooo!</p>

      <h3> Where I'll Go </h3>
        <p class=text>
          I'm passionate about contributing to causes that empower underrepresented
          communities. In my opinion, education is such a pivotal instrument of
          empowerment. So, the lack of quality and barriers to access of resources
          in primary and seconday education within certain communities really
          concerns me. As a developer, I'd like to be involved in contributing
          toward solutions that can be that enhance students' lives and create
          an impactful change. Therefore, upon finishing the FSI program, I plan
          to target EdTech companies in my job search.

          I also plan to get involved with organizations, like CodeNOW and
          Girl Develop It, where I can mentor youths, particularly girls, who
          are interested in programming.
