        <h2> Where I've Been </h2>
          <p class="text">
            The path I travelled to pursue programming is kind of a meandering one.
            I started off by studying Economics as an undergrad and working in Investment
            Management after graduation. While I loved working with my clients and
            studying the economic forces that drive the market, I found this career
            to be a bit too dry and I needed to be more creative. So, I searched
            something that would allow me to engage my creative side more and I eventually
            landed on interior design. As a designer, I found that I loved the
            creative problem solving aspects of the work. However, the day-to-day
            was not particularly challenging and I needed something that was going to
            challenge me while engaging both my creative and analytical sides. So,
            I searched again and landed on programming, which is most definitely
            challenging, creative and analytical. A perfect fit!
          </p>

        <h2> Where I'm Currently</h2>
          <p class="text">
            I'm just a few days away from starting the Full Stack Immersive (FSI) program
            at Galvanize and I'm so excited. At this point, I have a bit of experience with Ruby,
            a faint familiarity of Javascript, and no experience with CSS/HTML outside
            of the gSchool prework. So, I consider myself a complete beginner at the
            start of the program. I have a lot to learn and thrilled to build my
            knowledge base with fellow students!
          </p>

            <p> I don't know .js, but let's goooooooooo-ooo!</p>

        <h2> Where I'll Go </h2>
          <p class=text>
            I'm passionate about contributing to causes that empower underrepresented
            communities. In my opinion, education is such a pivotal instrument of
            empowerment. So, the lack of quality and barriers to access of resources
            in primary and seconday education within certain communities really
            concerns me. As a developer, I'd like to be involved in contributing
            toward solutions that can be that enhance students' lives and create
            an impactful change. Therefore, upon finishing the FSI program, I plan
            to target EdTech companies in my job search.

            I also plan to get involved with organizations, like CodeNOW and
            Girl Develop It, where I can mentor youths, particularly girls, who
            are interested in programming.
